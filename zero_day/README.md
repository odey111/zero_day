Create a file README.md with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small Markdown text to present this project. This file is mandatory in projects
Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
